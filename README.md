# Scheme SICP
The purpose of this repository is to organzie all of the Scheme code I write while I go through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

All of the code here can be run on DrRacket which is freely available on any platform.
Note: In order for DrRacket to provide complete support for Scheme used in SICP follow this guide.
